# The-US-Soldier-Race-Prediction-Project

In this project, I aimed to create a model to predict Hispanic soldiers in The United States Military, by using the ANSUR II working databases.
Firstly, to choose the best model for the data, I applied some ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree and so on.
Focused on recall scores to not miss the my target group members and prepared the model up to phase of deployment.
